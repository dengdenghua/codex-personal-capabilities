# SolidWorks 本地控制

## Optional isolated-instance mode (installed 2026-10-15)

The user requested and validated opt-in parallel SolidWorks instances. See
[parallel runtime instructions](<LOCAL_PATH> before using
`sw_parallel_*` or `parallel_cli.py`. Those tools bind an exact ROT PID plus
creation time, reserve disjoint workspaces, and serialize within each instance.
Two registered instances can work concurrently. The pool holds the legacy queue
barrier until all its sessions are released; legacy jobs must finish first.

The single-instance admission and machine-wide serialization rules below remain
the default for legacy `sw_*` tools and existing custom COM scripts. For the new
parallel entry point, use its explicit-identity admission gate instead; numerical
memory limits are unchanged and all SW processes count toward them. Never bypass
either gate or use `GetActiveObject` inside a purported parallel custom script.
Old scripts do not gain concurrency automatically. Flow, global settings and
neutral import remain on the exclusive legacy path. No force termination is
permitted. Normal ExitApp is limited to an empty instance created by the pool.

## Connect and identify the document

- Before COM work, run the shared performance gate using
  `<LOCAL_PATH: configure on this computer>` and
  `<LOCAL_PATH: configure on this computer>`.
  Read the shared [performance recycling rules](<LOCAL_PATH>
  Stop new loads/rebuilds/exports on a blocked gate. It is safe to inspect OS metrics
  while a CAD job runs; do not run an additional COM session probe then.
- Keep at most two task-owned independent windows and recycle each completed case
  before opening the next revision. Loaded assembly dependencies are counted
  separately. Use the shared scoped recycler inside the serialized CAD job;
  check child dirty flags and saved checkpoints, not just the assembly save flag.
  `sw_close_clean` alone is insufficient to establish that an assembly's children
  are safe to close. Never discard old/other-task unsaved models to reclaim RAM.
- Recheck child save flags after the LAST review/rebuild, even when the assembly
  is already saved. Use the shared post-review checkpoint sequence before recycling.
- Label presented screenshots with revision, view and candidate/verified status.
  Keep baseline/older views on the left and newer views on the right; distinguish
  trial branches from the selected native deliverable. Verify appearance from the
  saved native view, not only from successful material-property API calls.

- Read `sw_health` first: it reports SW/importer/solver processes and the job lock without
  touching COM, so it stays safe during a long import or solve.
- Read `sw_session` to get real document paths, titles and dirty flags. Select the exact
  path or a unique title; the active document is never an implicit target.
- Call `sw_start` only when no SW process exists. If a process exists but COM is
  unreachable, inspect the session/elevation mismatch instead of starting a duplicate.
- A scratch/leftover document is only ever the one this plugin created; the user's open
  models are never closed, and `sw_close_clean` refuses anything with unsaved changes.

## Job contract

- Every CAD tool returns a `job_id` and is serialised machine-wide. Poll `sw_job_status`;
  a `submitted` reply never means the model was built.
- Read the nested result: status, errors, warnings and the actual measured geometry.
  A `completed` job with `verified: false` is not a successful model.
- Never retry a mutation because a request timed out, and never delete the lock by hand.
  A dead worker with no result is only released through `sw_acknowledge_dead_job`, and
  only after no SW/importer process remains.
- Native inputs open read-only by default; outputs and copies always require NEW absolute
  paths and existing files are never overwritten.

## Part modelling

For geometry edits, historical-part replacements or assembly position changes, read
[修改正确性检查](references/change-verification.md). Define the intended functional
change before choosing features; verify changed boundaries and affected mating chains.
Successful API calls, valid solids, unchanged transforms and rebuild/save success do
not establish that the modification is correct. Pure visibility/rename/save-copy work
does not require a new full mechanical audit.

`sw_create_part(plan, output_path)` builds a NEW part from a millimetre JSON plan and
verifies it before saving. Plan and schema: [references/modeling-plan.md](references/modeling-plan.md).

- Sketch entities: `line`, `rectangle` (centre), `corner_rectangle`, `circle`, `arc`,
  `polygon`, `slot`, `spline`. A sketch-driving feature needs a CLOSED contour.
- Features: `extrude_boss` (blind or `through_all`), `extrude_cut` (blind or
  `through_all`), `extrude_midplane`, `fillet`, `chamfer`, `shell`.
- Reference a sketch by its 1-based index in `sketches` or by a literal sketch name.
  Reference an earlier feature the same way for patterns.
- `fillet`/`chamfer` take `"edges": "all"` or point picks `[{"point": [x, y, z]}]` in mm;
  the nearest edge is selected. `shell` takes `"faces": "none"` for a closed shell or
  point picks to open it.
- Always supply a `verify` block. Without one the geometry is measured but `verified`
  stays false, because nothing was compared against an expectation.
- Prefer an analytic expectation (a volume you can compute) over a self-referential one.
  A plan that fails discards its own unsaved scratch document, so a failure leaves no
  half-built part behind and writes no file.

### Not supported - do not fake it

Measured on this build (SOLIDWORKS 2026 SP3.2, COM revision 34.3.2): the pattern and
mirror APIs return `False` and change NOTHING, while reporting no error. The tools
therefore refuse them rather than silently emitting a part that lacks the pattern.

- `linear_pattern`, `circular_pattern`, `mirror_feature` are unsupported.
- Instead, put every repeated or mirrored entity in ONE sketch. A 3-hole array and a
  4-hole plate built that way matched their analytic volumes exactly.
- `arc` and `spline` sketch fine, but a closed contour made from them was not verified;
  use `circle`/`slot`/`polygon`/`corner_rectangle` or an explicit loop of `line` entities
  for a contour that must extrude.
- `hole_wizard` is a stub in the local helper library and is not exposed here; model a
  counterbore or a tapped hole as explicit circles, or use the worker UI.

## Assemblies, drawings, exports

- `sw_create_assembly(plan, output_path)` adds components at mm offsets, applies
  `coincident`/`concentric`/`distance`/`parallel` mates (exact entity names such as
  `Face1@Part1-1`), fixes what you ask it to, then saves. Mate error codes are NOT read
  there: run `sw_mate_status` on the saved assembly before trusting the fit, and
  `sw_interference` before calling the fit intentional.
- `sw_create_drawing(plan, output_path)` makes a drawing from an existing model with
  standard or named views, notes, and optional PDF export.
- `sw_save_copy` writes native copies and STEP/Parasolid/STL exports to NEW paths.
  An assembly copy is not Pack and Go; it still references the original dependencies.
- `plan.exports` accepts `step`, `stl` and `pdf` alongside the native save.

## Inspect and review before claiming success

- `sw_inspect` reads features and solid bounds; `sw_components` lists top-level assembly
  components with reference paths, suppression and transforms.
- `sw_view` writes a BMP preview - look at it. `sw_interference` and `sw_mate_status`
  report what the geometry actually does.
- Geometry that rebuilt, saved and exported is still not a reviewed design. State what
  was measured, and what remains unverified.

## Flow simulation

- Treat installed files, loaded add-in, readable project, running solver, completed solve
  and converged results as six separate pieces of evidence.
- Before solving, the model directory is archived in full to a NEW outside directory;
  unsaved in-memory changes are recorded, never silently saved or discarded.
- Do not run other CAD mutations while a solver runs, and never retry a failed solve.
- A completed job with `solver_execution_verified: false` is NOT a solved case, and
  convergence is not proof that the user's thermal design is validated.

## Runtime

Runtime `<LOCAL_PATH: configure on this computer>` holds the job queue, logs and validation evidence; this is a
machine-specific plugin, not a portable SolidWorks installation. Sources: `server.py`
(MCP surface), `worker.py` (COM dispatch), `model_tools.py` (declarative modelling),
`jobs.py` (durable single-writer broker).

If a conversation has not loaded the plugin MCP yet, the CLI fallback is:

```powershell
& '<LOCAL_PATH> '<LOCAL_PATH> session --wait 10
```

Pass parameters as a UTF-8 JSON file with `--args-file` and poll with `status --job-id ID`.
